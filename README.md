# scanse-3D-mapping
Simple 3D mapping using Scanse Sweep v1.0

3D printed mount for the MG995 tower pro servo.
Details setup guide is available in the documents above.
The point cloud was plotted in the Sweep Visualizer Beta.

Data conversion was modified from the project done by the other team.
**Error handling** is important to keep the device from scanning.
